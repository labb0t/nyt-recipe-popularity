## Clean Code:

- I love the use of .py modules
- I'm especially impressed with the nytc_modeling.py functions, very efficient way to try multiple models and recieve multiple metrics back at once in a clean way
- Good combination of markdown cells and inline code comments to explain what's being done & its reasoning; clean and readable 

## Good Documentation:

- Good job including links to various notebooks with explanations and .py dependencies in the README (one link is incorrect though--you reference the scraper.py but it links to cleaner.py. Not a big deal just so you know!)
- Be sure to include your name, tools used, and a high level summary of your results/findings of the project in your README!
- Great use of docstrings on .py modules, clear explanations of each function
- I'd love to see a markdown cell at the end with an explanation of "conclusions" or "takeaways" summarizing the what analysis you take away from this! Particularly with regards to the important features. 

## Proper Data Science:

- Good scraping modules and very proficient use of Beautiful Soup
- Made great use of try/except clauses to maximize data retention even when some rows missing
- EDA/cleaning choices well explained, nice job with necessary feature transformation 
- Interesting way of incorporating author name into the features -- I wouldn't have thought of this! Shows domain knowledge. 
- Various models and cross validation implemented correctly -- I liked your way of printing out lassocv model coefficients, and of iterating through a range of number of features to include to find ideal number to balance R^2 and overfitting. Innovative!
- Very reproducible code overall
- A clear command demonstrated of Python, Pandas, and Regression

## Comments:

- Great work on project 2!!
- Really well designed and thoughtful approach, with thorough exploration & analysis following a logical flow
- "The Stew" famously went viral haha :)
